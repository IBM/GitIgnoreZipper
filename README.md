# GitIgnoreZipper
Utility to recurse a git repo, examine the .gitignore files and zip up content being kept from the repository (optionally providing a .overrides to continue to ignore select directories or files). This allows the missing files from a cloned repo to be added to that repo providing a full development environment.
